Patch your player server:
    1. See the README files in the patches directory.

Build the driver:
    1. Run 'make' to build the driver, or 'make DEBUG=0' to build it
       without any debugging information included (e.g. release version).

Using the driver:
    1. Modify surveyor.cfg to your liking.
    2. Run 'player surveyor.cfg'

Extra tools:
    1. BlobConfig: calibrate blob tracking on the Surveyor in real time;
       This tool is very useful for configuring the blobfinder interface.
        a. Dependencies: SDL, SDL_image, SDL_gfx
           To install them on Ubuntu, run the following command:
           'sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev'
        b. Run 'make BlobConfig' to build the program.
        c. Run './BlobConfig <dev>' to run the program.
        d. Using the program:
              -Use the mouse to select regions on the image
              -'I' key updates the image
              -'U' key undoes changes
              -'R' key resets all changes
              -'P' key prints the current configuration data
